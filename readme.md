A repo to showcase showing list of items using paging3 library

## Instructions

To display maps, make sure you have local.properties with:
MAPS_API_KEY=<your google maps api key here>

## Some explanations

Tried to implement offline first functionality with paging3 library
API endpoint used (mockapi.io): "https://60fe7e7e2574110017078616.mockapi.io/api/v1/:endpoint"

./gradlew build should work

Typical android MVVM solution

View-> VM -> Domain (repo) -> Service/Storage

There are some unit and instrumentation tests added.
